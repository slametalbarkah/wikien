            Mitter Bedi (26 January 1926 – 11 March 1985) was an Indian photographer, specialising in industrial photography, and a teacher. Prior to his interest in the field there was little photographic use in advertising and his images have become classic icons. He was a recipient of several awards and he had his own photographic agency in Bombay (now Mumbai), which became well known in Asia.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life ==<br/><br/>Mitter Bedi was born in Lahore, British India, on 26 January 1926. He studied at the D.A.V. School in Lahore from 1930 to 1940. He relocated to Bombay in 1940 and pursued his college education from the Vidyasagar College in Calcutta from 1940 to 1943. He married Sarla Goenka, and they had three daughters, Preeti, Jyoti, and Gayatri.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Career ==<br/><br/>Bedi started his career by working for a printing press and the publicity department of a commercial firm and then took up a job in the film industry in 1947, the year of the partitioning of India and Pakistan into independent nations. At the start of his career in the early 1950s, his photographic assignments covered small events, mostly related to weddings and birthday celebrations or serving as the third or fourth assistant to a Bollywood film director. He frequented the airport to photograph passengers departing and arriving, which prompted his father-in-law B.N. Goenka, an industrialist, to suggest that Bedi change professions or travel abroad.
