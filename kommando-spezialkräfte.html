            The Kommando Spezialkräfte (KSK) (English: Special Operations Forces (SOF), alternatively Special Operations Forces Command (SOFCOM)) is a unified combatant command and a large brigade-level unit of the German Army (Heer) designated to perform covert operations, capture or kill high-value targets, undertake counterterrorism and hostage rescue crisis management, manage decapitation attacks, direct action, executive protection, irregular warfare, ISTAR, quick maneuver military emergencies situation, special warfare, as well as act as a military advisor. The KSK is under the command and control of the Rapid Forces Division (DSK) when on routine duty and is stationed in the Graf Zeppelin barracks in Calw, Baden-Württemberg.<br/><br/>The British Special Air Service (SAS), the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), and the German Federal Police's GSG 9 (Grenzschutzgruppe 9) of the former Federal Border Protection (Bundesgrenzschutz) (BGS) served as models for the formation and alignment of the KSK.<br/><br/>The KSK has received decorations and awards from NATO, the United States, and its affiliates. KSK operatives have taken part in joint anti-terror operations, notably in the Balkans and Middle East.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>From 1973 until the KSK's formation in 1996, the West Germany (and later Federal Republic of Germany) government assigned all anti-irregular military, counterterrorism and hostage rescue crisis management, long-range penetration, and special warfare operations activities to GSG 9, a highly trained police force created shortly after the Munich massacre that transpired during the 1972 Munich Olympic Games. Before 1973, the army's Fernspählehrkompanie 200 (FSLK200) (Long Range Reconnaissance Patrol Company), the navy's Kampfschwimmer (KSM) (commando frogmen), and until 1989 the Special Weapons Escort Companies—Sonderwaffenbegleitkompanien were the only military units comparable to anything that other nations may have seen as dedicated special forces units.<br/><br/>One political reason for the establishment of the KSK was that in 1994, during the Rwandan genocide, German citizens had to be evacuated by Belgian Para-Commando Brigade. This task was carried out by special operations forces of the former colonial power Belgium as agreed upon in advance by the NATO partners. The Federal Government of Germany chose not to intervene directly, as it believed neither the Federal Border Protection's GSG 9 counterterrorism and hostage rescue unit nor the German Army Paratrooper Commando Companies B1 were trained for irregular warfare, and there was also a lack of necessary transport capability. Several Belgian soldiers died during this operation.
