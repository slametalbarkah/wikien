<h1>Kyi Maung</h1>
            
            Colonel Kyi Maung (Burmese: ကြည်မောင်, pronounced [tɕì màʊɴ]; 20 December 1920 – 19 August 2004) was a Burmese Army officer and politician. Originally a member of the military-backed Union Revolutionary Council that seized power in 1962, Kyi Maung resigned from the ruling council in 1963 after a public disagreement with General Ne Win, the leader of the council, on the military's long-term role in government. He joined the National League for Democracy, led by Aung San Suu Kyi, in 1988 and won a seat in the Hluttaw from Bahan Township in the 1990 general election. He was vice-chairman of the NLD from 1988 to 1997. He was imprisoned four times for a total of 12 years by successive military governments.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life ==<br/><br/>Kyi Maung was born on 20 December 1920 to Ngwe Khin and her husband Po Thein in Rangoon (now Yangon), British Burma to a family of Teochew-Burmese heritage. He enrolled in Rangoon University in 1936, and became a fervent anti-colonialist. He participated in 1938 nationwide strikes and rallies against the British colonial regime. He nearly died after he was severely beaten in his head by the police on 20 December 1938, which is now commemorated as Bo Aung Kyaw Day in Myanmar. He was by his fellow student striker Aung Kyaw, who was also severely beaten by the police, until Aung Kyaw's last breath.
