            Ozan Varol (born December 1, 1981) is a Turkish author and was a tenured law professor at Lewis &amp; Clark Law School.<br/><br/><br/><br/>He is best known for coining the phrase "democratic coup" and authoring the book The Democratic Coup d'État.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life and career ==<br/><br/>Varol was born and raised in Istanbul, Turkey. He moved to the United States at the age of 17 for his undergraduate studies where he received a bachelor's degree in Planetary Sciences from Cornell University in 2003. During his time at Cornell, he served as a member of the operations team for NASA's 2003 Mars Exploration Rover project; which sent two rovers to examine the Martian surface. Varol later earned a Juris Doctor degree from the University of Iowa College of Law in 2007.<br/><br/>As an associate professor at the Lewis &amp; Clark Law School in Portland, Oregon, he taught constitutional law, criminal law, and comparative constitutional law. He is best known for his book The Democratic Coup d'État, published in 2017, which expands on his article of the same name, published in the Harvard International Law Journal in 2012. Both works explore the idea that a democracy can sometimes be established by a military coup. Foreign Policy magazine used Varol's criteria to analyze whether the 2013 Egyptian coup d'état that removed Mohammad Morsi from power was democratic.
