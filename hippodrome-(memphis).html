<h1>Hippodrome (Memphis)</h1>
            
            The Hippodrome was a music venue at 500 Beale Street in Memphis. The venue was opened in 1950 as a skating rink for African-Americans and later became a nightclub. In 1955, the Hippodrome was reopened as the Club Ebony. In 1961, under new owners, it went back to being called the Hippodrome until its closure in 1968.<br/><br/>The venue was a stop on the "Chitlin' Circuit," a selection of venues considered safe and acceptable for African-American entertainers in the era of racial segregation in the United States.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>The Hippodrome was opened by businessman Emmett Werne on December 16, 1950. The building, which cost $100,000 to construct, was located at 500 Beale Street in Memphis, Tennessee. The Hippodrome was operated by John T. Miles, a Black college graduate, and he had a staff that included two skating instructors.<br/><br/>By 1952, the venue had become a hotspot to showcase local and national blues and R&amp;B musical acts. In 1954, DJ Dewey Phillips, host of the WHBQ radio show "Red, Hot, and Blue," held a dance at the Hippodrome.
