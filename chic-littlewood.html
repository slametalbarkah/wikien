<h1>Chic Littlewood</h1>
            
            Cecil "Chic" Littlewood (17 November 1930 – 11 January 2015) was a New Zealand television entertainer and actor.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Biography ==<br/><br/>Born on 17 November 1930 in southeast London, England, Littlewood originally worked as a baker. He had a gift for mimicry, but his shyness meant he did not use it for entertainment purposes for several years, until he started appearing in—and winning—talent shows. He was offered an audition by the BBC in 1964, but had already accepted assisted passage to New Zealand.<br/><br/>Littlewood arrived in Auckland in 1964 with wife and two sons, working initially as a baker, but also hoping to continue in show business. He appeared on NZBC talent show Have A Shot and through this gained several other television parts. In 1967, Littlewood got a guest spot on the Kevan Moore-produced show The Late Show, which was well enough received that he became a regular on the show's following season.<br/><br/>In 1975 Littlewood was approached by Moore to put together an after-school programme for the newly launched South Pacific Television (SPTV). Littlewood created a new show, Now C Here, which morphed into Chicaboom and then Chic Chat, a regular daily afternoon children's show, in which Littlewood used his mimicry skills to create an ensemble of characters. The show moved to TV One after the amalgamation of TVNZ and South Pacific Television in 1980, where it ran twice-weekly until 1983.
