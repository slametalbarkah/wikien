<h1>Emine Hatun</h1>
<img alt="Emine Hatun" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c7/Coat_of_arms_of_the_Ottoman_Empire_%281882%E2%80%931922%29.svg"/>
            
            Emine Hatun (Ottoman Turkish: امینه خاتون, lit. 'benign' or 'trusthworthy'; died in 1449) was the legal wife of Sultan Mehmed I of the Ottoman Empire and the mother of his successor Murad II. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life ==<br/><br/>Emine Hatun was born as a Dulkadirid princess, the daughter of Nasir al-Dīn Mehmed, fifth ruler of the Beylik of Dulkadir (reign 1399–1442) and his consort Khadija Khatun. Her niece Sittişah Hatun, daughter of her brother Zülkadiroğlu Süleyman Bey, married Mehmed II in 1449.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Marriage ==<br/><br/>In 1403, when Mehmed had defeated his brother İsa Çelebi and İsfendiyar Bey, the ruler of the Isfendiyarids who had formed an alliance with each other, he returned to Rum, and decided to make some alliances of his own. While he was feasting in Tokat, Karamanid ruler Mehmed Bey sent his head military judge, and ambassadors also arrived from the realm of Dulkadirids. Relations were mended and animosity was removed. Then there was made peace and friendship between them. At that time, gifts and tokens of betrothal were sent to the Emine Hatun, who was thus engaged to the Sultan. Mehmed Çelebi's important marriage alliance with the ruler of the neighboring tribal confederation of Dulkadir, which was especially rich in horses and horsemen, demonstrates his continued emphasis on tribal politics. The alliance proved a great value for Nasireddin Mehmed Bey. This not only gave Mehmed armed assistance in his campaign for empire, but was always ready to attack the eastern provinces of the Karamanid principality.
