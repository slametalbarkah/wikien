            The Kanin class were a class of destroyers of the Soviet Navy during the Cold War. The Soviet designation was Project 57A Gnevny (not to be confused with the World War II era Project 7). These ships were the first Soviet guided missile destroyers and were initially designated Project 57bis (or 57b) and known to NATO as the Krupny class. Their primary mission was anti-surface warfare using the SS-N-1 anti-ship missile.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Design ==<br/><br/>Designed from as gun armed destroyers with 3 pairs of 130mm guns, their layout was completed in 1956. However, in February 1957, the incoming chief of staff, Admiral Sergey Gorshkov ordered changes after missile armed versions of the Kotlin class were deemed unsuccessful. Their initial purpose was surface engagement with opposing naval vessels and shore targets. The SS-N-1 missile installed in this class for that specific mission. The destroyers carried two launchers for the SS-N-1, one located at each end of the ship, each magazine holding six additional missiles.<br/><br/>The hull was scaled up from the Kotlin class, and the machinery was the same as those ships, except that remote control stations were installed and electrical generating capacity was increased.
