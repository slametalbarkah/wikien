            Albert Aaron Rosenfeld (28 July 1885 – 7 September 1970) was a pioneer Australian rugby league footballer, a national representative whose club career was played in Sydney and in England. He played for New South Wales in the first rugby league match run by the newly created 'New South Wales Rugby Football League' which had just split away from the established New South Wales Rugby Football Union. During his 16-year English career he set a number of try-scoring records including the standing world first-grade record of 80 tries in a season in 1913–14.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Australian career ==<br/><br/>Born in Sydney, the son of a Jewish tailor, Rosenfeld was a foundation player for the Eastern Suburbs club in the Australian inaugural season 1908 and in 1909. He played on Easter Monday 1908 in the Easts team that beat Newtown 32–16 on the first day of rugby league premiership football in Australia.<br/><br/>A stand-off, Rosenfeld represented his country in four Test matches. He made his Test début in Australia's first ever international series against New Zealand in 1908 where he appeared in all three matches. Later that season he was selected for Australia's inaugural Kangaroo Tour of 1908–09, making one Test appearance and playing in 13 minor representative matches.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== English career ==<br/><br/>Whilst on tour Rosenfeld signed with English club Huddersfield after falling in love with Ethel (née Barrand) a local mill manager's daughter whom he later married. He was moved to the wing position by his new club and became a try scoring sensation.
