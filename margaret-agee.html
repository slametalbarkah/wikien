Agee was then appointed to Aorere College, where she was first junior counsellor and then head of guidance. She was appointed as a lecturer at the University of Auckland in 1990, where she later completed a PhD. One of Agee's doctoral students is the first Pacific person to graduate with a PhD in counselling from Auckland, Toleafoa Sarah Sala Va'afusuaga McRobie.<br/><br/>Agee lectures in professional supervision, and also researches on loss and grief. Agee has been actively involved with the National Association for Loss and Grief, and was a founding member and serves on the board of the Grief Centre.
