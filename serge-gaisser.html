            Serge Gaisser (born 5 January 1958) is a French former professional footballer who played as a midfielder and is best known for his years with FC Basel and FC Mulhouse.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Career ==<br/><br/>Born in Muespach, Gaisser grew up in Saint-Louis, Haut-Rhin and started his football by the localclub Saint-Louis Neuweg, who at that time played in the French Division 3, the third tier of French football. However, he started his professional football career by Racing Besançon in the 1977–78 French Division 2. But because he only played in six games during the entire season as the team finished in second position in the league, Gaisser returned somewhat disillusioned to Saint-Louis, who in the meantime had suffered relegation.<br/><br/>A year later Gaisser signed for FC Basel, under head coach Helmut Benthaus, at the begin of the 1979–80 Nationalliga A season. In the pre-season Gaisser played in nine test games. Two of these were in the 1979 Uhrencup and in the final against Grenchen) he scored a goal as Basel won 4–1 to lift the trophy. Gaisser played his domestic league debut for his new club in the home game in the St. Jakob Stadium on 11 August 1979 as Basel won 2–1 against Sion. He scored his first goal for his new team on 25 November in the home game as Basel won 7–0 against Lugano.
