            General Sir Warren Marmaduke Peacocke KCH CTS KC (21 September 1766–22 August 1849) was a British Army officer of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, most notable for his command of the Lisbon garrison during the Peninsular War. Peacocke joined the British Army in 1780, serving with a series of units before transferring to the Coldstream Guards in 1793. After having served as an aide de camp during the Irish Rebellion of 1798, Peacocke fought as a company commander with his regiment in the Egypt Campaign between 1800 and 1801, for which he was made a Knight of the Order of the Crescent by the Ottoman Empire. He subsequently served with the Coldstream Guards on the Hanover Expedition in 1805 and Copenhagen Expedition in 1807.<br/><br/>Promoted to colonel in 1808, Peacocke served with his regiment at the beginning of the Peninsular War, fighting at the Second Battle of Porto. In June 1809 he left regimental service to take up post as Commandant of Lisbon, which he would hold until the end of the Peninsular War. Tasked with organising troops ready to join the Duke of Wellington's army, as well as with arranging the rehabilitation of injured soldiers and coordinating with the Portuguese government, Peacocke was promoted to brigadier-general in May 1811 and major-general in June. He was made a Knight Commander of the Tower and the Sword by Portugal and a Knight Bachelor by Britain for his services during the Napoleonic Wars. <br/><br/>Not sent on active service again after the wars, Peacocke was promoted to lieutenant-general in 1821 and then appointed to the sinecure of the governorship of Kinsale in 1830. He was subsequently promoted to general in 1838 and became colonel of the 19th Regiment of Foot in 1843.
