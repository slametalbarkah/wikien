            Alexander Alexandrovich Novikov (Russian: Алекса́ндр Алекса́ндрович Но́виков; 19 November [O.S. 6 November] 1900 – 3 December 1976) was the chief marshal of aviation for the Soviet Air Forces during the Soviet Union's involvement in the Second World War. Lauded as "the man who has piloted the Red Air Force through the dark days into the present limelight", and a "master of tactical air power", he was twice given the title of Hero of the Soviet Union as well as a number of other Soviet decorations.<br/><br/>A gifted air force commander and one of the leading men of the Soviet armed forces, Novikov was involved in nearly all exploits of the air force during the war and was at the forefront of developments in command and control and of air combat techniques. After the war, Novikov was arrested by order of the Politburo, and was forced by the NKVD chief, Lavrentiy Beria, into a "confession" that implicated Marshal Georgy Zhukov in a conspiracy. Novikov was then imprisoned until the death of Joseph Stalin in 1953, whereupon he became an avionics teacher and writer until his death.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life and career ==<br/><br/>Novikov was born in Kryukovo, a village in Nerekhta, in Kostroma Oblast. In 1919 he became an infantryman in the Red Army, and in 1920 became a party member.<br/><br/>He served in the 384th regiment of the Russian 7th Army, helped put down the Kronstadt uprising in March 1921, and he served as a platoon commander during anti-guerrilla fighting in the Caucasus in 1922. Having graduated from the M. V. Frunze Military Academy in 1930, Novikov moved to the air force in 1933, and served as chief of operations until 1935, when he took command of a light bomber squadron.<br/><br/>Novikov was expelled from the party and the armed forces in 1937; however, he was re-admitted by the Commissioner of the Byelorussian Military District, A. I. Mezis, who was in turn arrested.
