            Al-Aba Oasis, or Afnan Oasis is one of the ancient oases in Al-Qatif Governorate, in the eastern region of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.  Al-Aba Oasis was the capital of the village of Umm Al-Sahek, located to the north of it, with an area of 950 square kilometers.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Label ==<br/><br/>It is mentioned in historical books by more than one name, including: “Al-Aba’a, Al-Abaa’, and Al-A’b.” It is believed that its origin is the word “Al-Abaa’ Tsahif”  Al-Abaa’, with the Ba’al, which often falls between the lettering and the Noun.  Such as easing the common people, so they are called “al-hamr” and “al-awr” in “al-Ahmar al-a’war.” And so on in abusive words.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>the early history of Muslims<br/><br/>The first to speak of it was Al-Masoudi who mentioned it as “Afnan” and said: “Afnan is water and palm trees [...] Al-Abbas bin Amr Al-Ghanawi wanted it to be revealed, and that was when he traveled from the water known as Al-Aba’a.  So Abu Saeed preceded him to me with water, and the length of this sabkha is seven miles, and between it and Basra is seven days, and it is two days away from the coast of the sea.” Al-Masoudi continues, saying: “It is Al-Qatif, and between Al-Qatif and the sea is a mile, and it has a city on the coast called Anak.<br/><br/>It was mentioned by Yaqut al-Hamawi, who said: “The mantle, with the opening, then the stillness, a unified Yaa, and an extended thousand;  A name for a sabkha known in the district of Bahrain as the shoes of Al-Qatif on the sword of the sea. It has smooth stones. It was called that because every valley played in it, and the attribution to it is similar to the attribution to Sana’ani, and the dogs are attributed to it, so it is said that the dogs are playable.”<br/><br/>Al-Aba without a hamza, with a dam then a sukun, and a unified yaa, so from the play there are palaces: it is a place in the house of Abdul Qais between Oman and Bahrain.  “On the authority of Al-Hazmi.”<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Geographical location ==<br/><br/>The location of the Al-Aba oasis is different but is most likely located 8 kilometers northeast of the town of Abu Ma'n and in the northwest of the present-day Umm Al-Sahek.
