            The Intervention Corps (Polish language: Korpus Interwencyjny) was a tactical unit of the Polish Armed Forces of the Second Polish Republic. It did not exist in the peacetime organization of the Polish Army, and was created for specific purposes only. Its task was to intervene in special circumstances, both inside Poland and outside of the country.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Composition ==<br/><br/>According to the Mobilization Plan W, prepared for the war with the Soviet Union (see Plan East), the following units were designed to form the Intervention Corps: <br/><br/><br/><br/>26th Infantry Division from Skierniewice,<br/><br/>28th Infantry Division from Warsaw,<br/><br/>10th Motorized Cavalry Brigade from Rzeszów.<br/><br/>Furthermore, some artillery, armored and motorized regiments were to be added to the Corps, as well as three armored trains, engineer platoons and military police regiments. The Mobilization Plan W was completed on May 1, 1938, but its details have not been preserved.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Operational history ==<br/><br/>On March 22, 1939, Marshall Edward Śmigły-Rydz signed Plan West for defense against a future invasion by Nazi Germany. All units marked with black in mobilization plan were designed to create the Main Reserve of the Commander in Chief (Odwod Glowny Naczelnego Wodza). On March 22, 1939, General Wacław Stachiewicz, who at that time was the Chief of General Staff of the Polish Army (see Polish General Staff) ordered mobilization of all units marked with red and yellow, plus some of these marked with green and black. The mobilization began at 4 p.m., on March 23.
