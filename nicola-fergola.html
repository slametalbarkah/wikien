            Nicola Fergola (29 October 1753 – 21 June 1824) was an Italian mathematician, professor in the university of Naples.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Life and work ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Fergola studied in the Jesuit school;    he then  went to the university of Naples in 1767, but he studied mathematics by his own because the university was only strong in law and medicine. From 1770 he was teaching, by royal appointment, in the Liceo del Salvatore, a school founded in the same building where the Jesuit school had been (the Jesuit order was suppressed three years before). Fergola also founded his own private school in Naples in 1771. This school quickly gained a high reputation and many of the brightest boys of the country were sent to be educated at Fergola's boarding school. Fergola taught and did research in both synthetic and analytic geometry, paying special attention to the physical application of calculus. The first works on the application of integral calculus to physical problems published in Naples where by him.<br/><br/>In 1799, during the Napoleonic period, he lived in Capodimonte but, when the Borbonic monarchy was restated, he was appointed to the mathematics chair in the university of Naples. In 1821 he suffered a stroke which left him disabled for the rest of his life.<br/><br/>Fergola was one of the protagonists of an ideological quarrel among the Neapolitan scientists at the end of 18th  and the first half of the 19th  century.
