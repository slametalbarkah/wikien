            Daryl Janmaat (born 22 July 1989) is a Dutch football executive and former professional player who played as a right back. He most recently served as technical director of ADO Den Haag.<br/><br/>Janmaat began his career at ADO Den Haag, and went on to play for Eredivisie clubs Heerenveen and Feyenoord. He then had stints in the Premier League with Newcastle United and Watford, before returning to the Netherlands, where he finished his professional career back at ADO Den Haag, finally retiring in 2022.<br/><br/>A full international between 2012 and 2018, Janmaat earned over 34 caps for the Netherlands and was part of the team which finished third at the 2014 FIFA World Cup.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Club career ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== ADO Den Haag ===<br/><br/>Born in Leidschendam, South Holland, Janmaat started his senior career in 2007–08, with ADO Den Haag in the Eerste Divisie.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Heerenveen ===<br/><br/>In the following off-season the 19-year-old moved straight into the Eredivisie, signing for SC Heerenveen. In Heerenveen's Europa League match against Hertha Berlin on 23 October 2009, Janmaat came on as a 73rd-minute substitute for Norwegian Christian Grindheim and received a red card three minutes later for a late challenge on Nemanja Pejčinović but Heerenveen held on for a 1–0 victory. After serving a required suspension, Janmaat scored in his next Europa League appearance on 16 December 2009, netting his side's final goal in a 5–0 win over FK Ventspils at the Abe Lenstra Stadion in Heerenveen but the win proved insufficient as Heerenveen failed to qualify for the knockout stages.<br/><br/>On 21 December 2011, Janmaat scored Heerenveen's ninth goal in an 11–1 thrashing of Eerste Divisie side FC Oss to reach the quarter-finals of the KNVB Beker.
