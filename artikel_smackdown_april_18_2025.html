                <p>Backlash France was a 2024 professional wrestling event produced by the American company WWE. It was the 19th Backlash event and took place on Saturday, May 4, 2024, at the LDLC Arena in Décines-Charpieu in the Metropolis of Lyon, France. The event aired via pay-per-view (PPV) and livestreaming and featured wrestlers from the promotion's Raw and SmackDown brand divisions. This was WWE's first PPV and livestreaming event to be held in France, and the first Backlash held outside of North America. The concept of the event was based around the backlash from WrestleMania XL.</p>
<p>Five matches were contested at the event. In the main event, Cody Rhodes defeated AJ Styles to retain SmackDown's Undisputed WWE Championship. The referee for the match was Jessika Carr, who became the first woman to referee a WWE world title main event. In other prominent matches, Damian Priest defeated Jey Uso to retain Raw's World Heavyweight Championship and Bayley defeated Naomi and Tiffany Stratton in a triple threat match to retain SmackDown's WWE Women's Championship. The event was also notable for the WWE in-ring debut of Tama Tonga, as well as the return of his adopted brother (biological cousin), Tonga Loa, who previously performed in WWE as Camacho from 2009 to 2014.</p>
<p>The event received highly positive reviews, with the main event and the Street Fight being deemed highlights of the night, as well as the strong crowd reactions similar to Backlash from the previous year. WWE reported that the event set the record for the largest arena gate in company history. The main event was awarded a 5-star rating from Dave Meltzer.</p>
<h3 id="section-production">Production</h3>
<h4 id="section-background">Background</h4>
<p>Backlash is a recurring professional wrestling event that was established by the American promotion WWE in 1999. It was held annually from 1999 to 2009, but was then discontinued until it was reinstated in 2016 and has been held every year since, except in 2019. The original concept of the event was based around the backlash from WWE's flagship event, WrestleMania. The events between 2016 and 2020 did not carry this theme; however, the 2021 event returned Backlash to this original concept.</p>
<p>In late October 2023, reports emerged that WWE were discussing plans to hold the 2024 Backlash in Paris, France. The following month on November 16, the company announced that the 19th Backlash would be held in France, but in Décines-Charpieu, in the Lyon Metropolis, on Saturday, May 4, 2024, at the newly constructed LDLC Arena, which opened that same month. This subsequently marked WWE's first pay-per-view (PPV) and livestreaming event to be held in the country, with the event in turn titled Backlash France, as well as the first Backlash held outside of North America. The event was based around the backlash of WrestleMania XL and featured wrestlers from the Raw and SmackDown brand divisions. It aired on PPV worldwide and was available to livestream on Peacock in the United States and the WWE Network in most international markets. Additionally, the May 3 episode of Friday Night SmackDown was held at the same arena, marking the first time that the program was broadcast from France. Tickets went on sale on January 12, 2024.</p>
<p>Professional wrestling in France dates back to the 1830s and exhibitions of Greco Roman wrestling in circuses. In the 1930s, French wrestling moved from Greco Roman to Catch wrestling. Between the early 1950s and late 1980s, France was one of two European countries, along with the United Kingdom, to have regular national television coverage of professional wrestling. As with British wrestling on ITV, French TV likewise made household names of wrestling stars. Some French wrestlers, notably André the Giant and Edouard Carpentier, went on to have successful American wrestling careers. By the mid-1980s, the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, renamed WWE in 2002) had invaded France and soon eclipsed local wrestling in popular culture.</p>
<h4 id="section-storylines">Storylines</h4>
<p>The event included five matches that resulted from scripted storylines. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers on the Raw and SmackDown brands, while storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television shows, Monday Night Raw and Friday Night SmackDown.</p>
<p>On Night 2 of WrestleMania XL, LA Knight defeated AJ Styles, while later that night in the main event, Cody Rhodes won SmackDown's Undisputed WWE Universal Championship. On April 12, it was announced that Rhodes's first challenger for the title would be determined by a tournament that would begin on that night's SmackDown. Knight and Styles subsequently won their respective triple threat matches. The following week, Styles defeated Knight to earn a shot for the now renamed Undisputed WWE Championship match against Rhodes at Backlash France.</p>
<p>On Night 2 of WrestleMania XL, Damian Priest cashed in his Money in the Bank contract to win Raw's World Heavyweight Championship. The next night on Raw, Jey Uso won a fatal four-way match to become the number one contender for the title, which was scheduled for Backlash France.</p>
<p>On Night 2 of WrestleMania XL, Bayley won SmackDown's WWE Women's Championship. On the following episode of SmackDown, Bayley said she wanted to give new opportunities to the other women on the roster to challenge her for the title. Tiffany Stratton interrupted to accept the opportunity; however, Bayley said that she was talking about giving Naomi a chance. Stratton then insulted Naomi, prompting her to come to the ring. After a discussion between Naomi and Stratton, they faced each other in a match to determine who would challenge Bayley for the championship, which Naomi won. The title match took place on the next episode, but ended in a no-contest after Stratton attacked both Bayley and Naomi. Another match between Naomi and Stratton was then scheduled for the next episode to determine who would challenge Bayley for the championship at Backlash France, but ended in another no-contest after interference from Nia Jax, who had been drafted to SmackDown earlier that night. SmackDown General Manager Nick Aldis then announced that Bayley would defend the WWE Women's Championship against both Naomi and Stratton in a triple threat match at Backlash France.</p>
<p>On Night 1 of WrestleMania XL, Bianca Belair and Jade Cargill's team defeated Damage CTRL (Dakota Kai, Asuka, and Kairi Sane) in a six-woman tag team match by way of Cargill pinning Sane. On the April 26 episode of SmackDown, it was announced that The Kabuki Warriors (Asuka and Sane) would defend the WWE Women's Tag Team Championship against Belair and Cargill at Backlash France.</p>
<p>Following his loss on Night 2 of WrestleMania XL, The Bloodline's leader Roman Reigns went on hiatus. Solo Sikoa then began taking charge of the group by removing Jimmy Uso and then introducing the debuting Tama Tonga on the April 12 episode of SmackDown, much to the dismay of the faction's special counsel Paul Heyman. The following week, the duo viciously assaulted Kevin Owens. On the April 26 episode, when The Bloodline again attempted to attack Owens, one of Owens's WrestleMania opponents who also had previous issues with The Bloodline, Randy Orton, made the save. Later that night, it was announced that Orton and Owens would face The Bloodline (Sikoa and Tonga) in a tag team match at Backlash France, marking Tonga's WWE in-ring debut.</p>

<p>The event opened with Kevin Owens and Randy Orton facing The Bloodline (Solo Sikoa and Tama Tonga, accompanied by Paul Heyman).

As Owens was going for the pin, the returning Tonga Loa pulled the referee out of the ring, marking Loa's first WWE appearance since 2014 when he performed under the ring name Camacho. Loa then hit both Owens and Orton with a steel step, allowing Sikoa to deliver the Spinning Solo to Owens onto a seated chair and then the Samoan Spike for the win.</p>

<h3 id="section-reception">Reception</h3>
<p>Backlash France held the largest gate for any arena show in WWE history, until it was broken at Clash at the Castle: Scotland in June 2024, which was then broken by Bash In Berlin in August 2024. Backlash France also broke the record for the lowest amount of pay-per-view buys for any WWE event in history. Journalists and wrestlers praised the Lyon crowd for their overwhelming reception throughout the event.</p>
<p>Doc-Chris Mueller of Bleacher Report graded the overall show an A, saying "For the second year in a row, WWE has hosted one of the best crowds of the year by taking Backlash somewhere outside the continental United States. The fans in Lyon helped make this an unforgettable PPV for the Superstars in the ring and everyone watching at home. The energy of a crowd can often impact a show in good and bad ways, but this show saw nothing but positivity and excitement. However, it was the men's and women's WWE Championship matches that gave us the best bell-to-bell action. Bayley, Naomi, Stratton, Styles and Rhodes all deserve praise for their performances on Saturday. As a whole, Backlash was a huge success."</p>
<p>John Canton of TJR Wrestling.net gave the show an 8 out of 10, saying "I thought it was a very entertaining show that benefited from one of the best crowds I’ve ever seen in my life. This was an all-time great crowd in Lyon, France. Kudos to WWE for doing a PLE in France so those of us in the rest of the world could experience what this amazing crowd is like. It reminds me of the Puerto Rico crowd at Backlash last year as one of the best ever. Anyway, I loved the crowd and I certainly won’t forget it. It really was one of the best WWE crowds that I have ever heard at a pro wrestling show".</p>
<p>Coby Galenzoski of Wrestling Republic gave the show a 4.5/5 stars, saying "WWE Backlash France 2024 is a very enjoyable show from start to finish. With an outstanding crowd that came to chant, it was electric in every single thing that happened. Most of the matches are of a very high quality, the semi main event had some flaws that don’t need to be mentioned again. The strongest match wasn’t the main event causing the structure to not be perfect. Every single match had their stories, and advanced them.</p>
<p>Man In Black of Wordpress.com simply said "Taking the PLE overseas is proving to be quite the good ideas as international crowds are clearly starved of live WWE wrestling and let it known by being so insanely vocal about it. I don’t know what this French crowd were saying or singing, or if they were going into business for themselves like US “smart” crowds but they were into everything all night long and made this come across as a much better show because of it".</p>
<p>Wrestling journalist Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter rated the following matches: the Street Fight 4.75 stars, the WWE Women's Championship match 4.5 stars, the World Heavyweight Championship match 3.5 stars, the Women's Tag Team Championship match 3 stars and the Undisputed WWE Championship match 5 stars; marking WWE's first 5 star rating of 2024.</p>
<h3 id="section-aftermath">Aftermath</h3>
<p>On the May 31 episode of SmackDown, AJ Styles seemingly announced his retirement, and called out Undisputed WWE Champion Cody Rhodes for a passing of the torch moment; however, after celebrating, Styles viciously attacked Rhodes. This led to an "I Quit" match between the two for the title at Clash at the Castle: Scotland.</p>
