            Tracey is a fictional character from the BBC soap opera EastEnders, portrayed by Jane Slaughter. Tracey has appeared as a significant extra since the first episode, which was broadcast on 19 February 1985, when she was seen working on the flower stall in Bridge Street Market but moved on to becoming a barmaid at The Queen Vic pub in 1989. Slaughter was not credited in the role until 1 May 1986, which was the first episode in which she spoke. Tracey's storylines have included brief sexual encounters with other EastEnders characters, consisting of Dennis Rickman (Nigel Harman), Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden), Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) and fellow extra, Winston (Ulric Browne), friendships with Debbie Bates (Nicola Duffett), Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor), Sean Slater (Robert Kazinsky), Shirley (Linda Henry) and Linda Carter (Kellie Bright), and Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth), and is the godmother of Debbie's daughter, Clare (Gemma Bissix). She has also worked multiple different jobs including being a florist on the market, a barmaid and cleaner in The Queen Vic and at The Albert, and a caterer in Ian's chip shop. She has been sacked from The Queen Vic three times, by Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons), Linda and Woody Woodward (Lee Ryan). Tracey is the longest-serving EastEnders character, as the other three remaining original characters, Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt), Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth) and Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean) have all taken extended breaks from the soap in the past. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Storylines ==<br/><br/>In May 1993, Sharon Mitchell (Letitia Dean) tells Nigel Bates (Paul Bradley) that she will be late for his birthday party as she will be attending Tracey's hen party. After Nigel meets and kisses Debbie Tyler (Nicola Duffett) during his birthday party, he asks Tracey where Debbie is. She replies that she left in a cab.
