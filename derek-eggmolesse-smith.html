            Derek Eggmolesse-Smith (born 4 May 1998) is an Australian rules footballer who last played for the Richmond Football Club in the Australian Football League (AFL). After being overlooked in the 2016 draft, he became the first player ever to be signed by the club under the Next Generation Academy rules when he was contracted in November 2017. He made his AFL debut for the club in round 16 of the 2019 season and later that year became a VFL premiership player while playing reserves grade football for the club. He was de-listed at the end of the 2020 season  but re-contracted ahead of the 2021 season after training with the team during the summer. He was not offered a new contract by the Richmond Football Club at the conclusion of the 2021 season.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life, junior and state-league football ==<br/><br/>Eggmolesse-Smith grew up in Wentworth, New South Wales, a country town on the border with Victoria near Mildura, and is of Indigenous Australian (Barkindji) descent. He played local junior football with Wentworth in the Sunraysia Football League (SNFL) including in an under 16s premiership in 2014 with fellow future AFL players Jarrod Brander and Kobe Mutch. While eligible for the Greater Western Sydney academy in Wentworth, a family move south of the border to Mildura made Eggmolesse-Smith eligible to join the Richmond academy in its first intake in 2016. He was one of the first members of the club's newly created Next Generation Academy program for young Indigenous and multicultural players from the Sunraysia region of northern Victoria.<br/><br/>In 2016 he was a standout player for Wentworth in SFNL, finishing the season by winning both the league's Rising Star and Best and fairest awards.
