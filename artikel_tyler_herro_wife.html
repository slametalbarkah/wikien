                <p>Tyler is a given name that is gender-neutral but predominantly male, as well as a surname.</p>
<p>It is an Old English name derived from the Old French tieuleor, tieulier (tiler, tile maker) and the Middle English tyler, tylere.  The name was originally an occupational name for a housebuilder, one who lays tiles or bricks. It also holds the meaning of "doorkeeper of an inn" or "owner of a tavern", derived from its use in freemasonry as the name of the office of the outer guard. Among the earliest recorded uses of the surname is Wat Tyler (1341–1381) of Kent, England.</p>
