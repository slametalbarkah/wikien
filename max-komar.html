            Max David Komar (born April 30, 1987) is a former American football wide receiver. He was signed by the Arizona Cardinals as an undrafted free agent in 2010. He played college football at Idaho.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== High school career ==<br/><br/>Komar attended Auburn Riverside High School in Auburn, Washington, where he recorded 113 receptions for 930 yards on the football team. Despite earning all-state honors as a senior, he did not receive any scholarship offers and decided to play college football at Idaho as a walk-on.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== College career ==<br/><br/>As a freshman at Idaho in 2005, Komar took a redshirt. The following season, he earned a starting spot and caught 17 passes for 313 yards. After being awarded a scholarship by first-year head coach Robb Akey, Komar emerged as Idaho's leading receiver in 2007, recording 30 receptions for 445 yards and four touchdowns. His stats declined in 2008 due to the offense heavily relying on Eddie Williams. In the 2009 Humanitarian Bowl, Komar caught a touchdown with four seconds left, which allowed the Vandals to win the game on a two-point conversion.
