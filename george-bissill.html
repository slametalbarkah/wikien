            George William Bissill (22 June 1896 – 14 September 1973) was a British miner, painter, and furniture designer. Bissill's paintings are held in a number of important public collections, including the Tate Gallery, National Museum of Northern Ireland and the Manchester Art Gallery. Bissill was known for his landscapes and figurative paintings in oil, watercolour and woodcuts.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>George Bissill was born in Fairford in Gloucestershire, but the family soon moved to the mining village of Langley Mill in Derbyshire where his father worked as a railway brakesman. At 13 George was sent down the mines, where he worked, initially with pit ponies, then at the coal face, until 1915 when he joined the Kings Royal Rifles (First Battalion) to fight in the First World War. He had hoped to escape the underground life but as an ex-miner he was immediately trained to be a sapper, tunnelling, defusing mines and laying mines under enemy lines. While working near Béthune in France, he suffered a catastrophic tunnel collapse and later in the war he was badly gassed. In 1918 he was invalided out of the army.<br/><br/>With his army pension, he spent a few months at Nottingham School of Art, but he had already developed his own distinctive style and subject matter, saying later that the pit was the only art school he needed.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== London and Paris ==<br/><br/>After a spell working as a village postman, during which he exhibited at the Ilkeston Arts Club annual exhibition in Derbyshire, he decided to try to take his work to London.
