            Kent Television (KTV) is the student-led television society at the University of Kent, Canterbury and is a media division of the university's student union, Kent Union. KTV was founded in May 2012 and within its first year has gone on to win 3 awards at NaSTA 2013, worked with the SU (Kent Union) and the university to gain a new Student Media Centre on the university campus and hit over 125,000 views on its YouTube Channel. Currently the channel has 250,000 views and over 700 subscribers, along with an additional 2 more awards at NaSTA 2015.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>KTV was founded by Robert Linton and David Horler early 2012. Initially, it was set up because they both found there was no society on campus that just let people go out and film things and make shows/films. With the help of Kent Union and Mel Lewis (Student Media Manager 2011 – 2013) KTV became a society in April 2012, and the first video was uploaded on 17 May 2012 and can be found here. At the end of the 2011/12 academic year KTV had also covered both of the big music festivals on campus Keynestock and the Kent Union Summerball.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== 2012/13 ===<br/><br/>At the beginning of the 2012/13 academic year KTV launched with a massive freshers campaign on-line and on-campus, by having a huge presence on Facebook and Twitter and recording freshers shows outside in the centre of campus for all to see. Still a new society, though making its first steps to Student Media status, this method was used to gain view, followers, subscribers and likes but also to gain a new membership. The membership was around 12 at the end of the last term but grew to around 40 within the first few weeks of term, and as of March 2013 the membership stands at exactly 50.
