            Baiju (Chinese: 白局) or Nanjing baiju, also called  baiqu (Chinese: 百曲), is a traditional type of Chinese singing-storytelling and a form of quyi, formed in the rural Luhe District in the city of Nanjing during the Yuan dynasty more than 600 years ago. Though belittled by the upper class, baiju was very popular among the lower classes. It is also the only kind of old local opera in Nanjing, known as a native art which includes singing and telling in the Nanjing dialect, and is particularly rich in rhyme. Baiju is often performed in the form of a solo monologue or a dialogue, like xiangsheng (a traditional Chinese oral art). When acted, it needs from two to five performers. It is very easy to understand, with strong local characteristics, but unfortunately, due to the decline of both performers and audiences, the prospects for baiju are not optimistic. The origin of its name is performers not receiving any pay for their show ("bai" here means "free", and "ju" means " a show").<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>Baiju has a history of over 600 years, although its earliest performers and tunes are untraceable now. Baiju originated between the end of the Ming dynasty and the beginning of the Qing dynasty, like other folk arts in China which were ignored by the ruling class and literary men. The earliest known of baiju is mentioned in a book by Li Dou (李鬥; a Qing dynasty drama writer), A Record of Yangzhou Gaily-Painted Pleasure-Boats (揚州畫舫錄).
