                <p>The 2019–20 Denver Nuggets season was the 44th season of the franchise in the National Basketball Association (NBA), and the franchise's 53rd season of existence overall.</p>
<p>The season was suspended by the league officials following the games of March 11 after it was reported that Rudy Gobert tested positive for COVID-19. On March 19, the Nuggets announced that one person from the team tested positive for COVID-19. The Nuggets were one of the 22 teams invited to the NBA Bubble on June 4.</p>
<p>In the playoffs, the Nuggets became the first team in playoffs history to come back from a 3–1 series deficit twice in the same playoff run. The Nuggets defeated the Utah Jazz in the first round in seven games, recovering from a 3–1 series deficit and advancing to the semifinals against the Los Angeles Clippers, whom they last faced in the playoffs in 2006. The Nuggets defeated the Los Angeles Clippers in the conference semifinals, also recovering from a 3–1 series deficit, where they subsequently advanced to the conference finals. In achieving this feat, the Nuggets became the first team in NBA history to ever recover from two 3–1 series deficits in the same postseason to advance to the next round; no previous team had ever even forced two Game 7s in that situation. The Nuggets advanced to their first Conference Finals since the 2008–09 season and faced the Los Angeles Lakers in a rematch of that series, in which the Lakers won in six games. This time, the Nuggets lost in five games and like 2009, the Lakers went on to win the championship. The Nuggets would eventually get their revenge in the 2023 conference finals, when they swept the Lakers and eventually won an NBA championship of their own.</p>
