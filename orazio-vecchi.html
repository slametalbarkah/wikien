            Orazio Vecchi (6 December 1550 (baptized) in Modena – 19 February 1605) was an Italian composer of the late Renaissance.  He is most famous for his madrigal comedies, particularly L'Amfiparnaso.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Life ==<br/><br/>He was born in Modena, and studied with Salvatore Essenga, a Servite friar there.  In addition he prepared for holy orders with early education at the Benedictine monastery, and took holy orders sometime before 1577.<br/><br/>By the end of the 1570s he was well-connected with the composers of the Venetian school (for example Claudio Merulo and Giovanni Gabrieli) since he collaborated with them in writing a sestina for a ducal marriage.  During this period he accompanied Count Baldassare Rangoni on his travels, going to Bergamo and Brescia.<br/><br/>He was maestro di cappella (director of music) at the Salò cathedral between 1581 and 1584.  Following this, he was the choirmaster at the cathedral of Reggio Emilia, until 1586.  In that year he moved to Correggio where he was appointed canon of the cathedral there; he composed copiously during his time there, though he felt isolated from the major musical centers of Italy such as Rome, Venice, Florence and Ferrara.  Eventually he attempted to correct this by moving back to Modena, where he attained the rank of mansionario (a priest who also had charge of the choir).
