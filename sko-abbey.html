            Sko Abbey (Swedish: Sko kloster), was a Cistercian nunnery in Sweden, in operation from 1230 until at least 1588. It was located in the Skokloster parish in Uppland. It was the predecessor of the baroque  Skokloster Castle.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>Sko monastery was founded around 1230 by Knut Långe. Byarums monastery was relocated to Sko in 1236. Sko Abbey was founded because an already existing convent, Byarum Abbey, which was founded in about 1170, was moved from Vaggeryd Municipality to Sko in the 1230s.<br/><br/>Sko Abbey seem to have functioned as a school for daughters of the nobility, and the nuns often came from noble families. <br/><br/>In 1520, the sister of Gustav I of Sweden, Margareta Eriksdotter Vasa, was given refuge there during the Stockholm Bloodbath.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Dissolution ===<br/><br/>During the Swedish Reformation in 1527, the Abbey was banned from accepting novices and its assets was confiscated by the crown in accordance with the Reduction of Gustav I of Sweden. The members were free to leave or to remain supported by an allowance from the estates formerly belonging to the Abbey.
