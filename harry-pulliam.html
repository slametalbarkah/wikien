He served from 1903 until his death in 1909. He was president during the period in which the National League and the fledgling American League settled their hostilities and formed a National Agreement which led to the creation of the World Series.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Biography ==<br/><br/>Harry Clay Pulliam was born on February 9, 1869, in Scottsville, Kentucky. Early in his life, his father, a tobacco businessman, moved the family to Louisville, where he attended public schools. Pulliam received his Juris Doctor degree from the University of Virginia School of Law.<br/><br/>In the late 1880s, after working for newspapers in California, Pulliam became a reporter for the Louisville Commercial, He quickly advanced through the ranks, and was considered one of the leading authorities on the game and history of baseball. Soon after receiving a promotion to City Editor of the Commercial, he met the owner of the Louisville Colonels, Barney Dreyfuss.
