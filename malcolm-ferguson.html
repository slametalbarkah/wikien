            Malcolm Andrew Ferguson-Smith,  (born 5 September 1931) is a British geneticist.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life and education ==<br/><br/>Ferguson-Smith was born in Glasgow in 1931, the son of physician John Ferguson-Smith and educated at Stowe School. He graduated from the University of Glasgow in 1955 with a Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery degree.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Career and research ==<br/><br/>In 1955–1956 he was House Physician and House Surgeon at the Western Infirmary in Glasgow and in 1956–1958 Senior House Officer (SHO) and Registrar in Pathology.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Johns Hopkins ===<br/><br/>In 1959 he was appointed a Fellow in Medicine at the School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore where he worked on chromosome analysis for nearly three years, establishing the first human chromosome diagnostic laboratory in the USA.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Return to Glasgow ===<br/><br/>In 1961 he returned to the Department of Genetics at the University of Glasgow and was appointed successively Lecturer, Senior Lecturer and Reader, becoming the first Burton Professor of Medical Genetics in 1973. Apart from teaching genetics to medical students his duties involved the establishment of a Regional Genetics Service for the West of Scotland. This provided opportunities for contributing to the human gene map using familial chromosome polymorphisms, deletion mapping, in situ hybridisation and chromosome sorting by flow cytometry. His work on mapping the Y-linked sex determinant in XX males led to the isolation of the mammalian sex-determining gene twenty-five years later.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Gene mapping ===<br/><br/>In 1987 he was appointed Professor and Head of the Department of Pathology at University of Cambridge and Director of the East Anglia Regional Genetics Service, where he furthered his research on gene mapping. He retired as Head of Pathology in 1998 and moved to the University Department of Veterinary Medicine.
