            Laurinburg–Maxton Airport (IATA: MXE, ICAO: KMEB, FAA LID: MEB) is a public use airport located three miles (5 km) north of the central business district of Maxton and east of Laurinburg. Maxton is located primarily in Robeson County, North Carolina, USA while Laurinburg is in Scotland County, North Carolina, USA as is the airport proper. This general aviation airport covers 4,290 acres (1,736 ha) and has two runways. It is home of the United States Army Parachute team Golden Knights.<br/><br/>Although most U.S. airports use the same three-letter location identifier for the FAA and IATA, Laurinburg–Maxton Airport is assigned MEB by the FAA and MXE by the IATA (which assigned MEB to Essendon Airport in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia). The airport's ICAO identifier is KMEB.<br/><br/>The airfield was constructed for the United States Army Air Force during World War II.  During the war the airfield was a large training base for glider-towing aircraft.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Today the airfield is noted for being the home of Charlotte Aircraft, a company which parts-out and scraps older aircraft.  Visitors to the airfield can see a number of 727s, DC-10s, 737s, and 747s in various stages of being dismantled and scrapped.<br/><br/>In 2006 the forward fuselage of Northwest Airlines' first 747-100 was removed from the aircraft at Maxton by Guard-Lee for installation in the National Air and Space Museum on the National Mall in Washington DC.  The remainder of the aircraft was scrapped and parted by Charlotte Aircraft at Laurinburg–Maxton Airport. This was replaced with N603US, which was the third Northwest Airlines 747-100.
