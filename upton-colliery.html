            Upton Colliery was a coal mine near to the village of Upton in the West Riding of Yorkshire, England. The site was 8.5 miles (13.7 km) north west of Doncaster and 10 miles (16 km) north east of Barnsley. Coal was transhipped from the colliery by the former Hull and Barnsley Railway line.<br/><br/>The colliery had a short life of only 40 years. Geological faulting and a serious explosion in 1964 led to its closure.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>Work on the site started in 1924, but preliminary works at the site meant that coal was not raised until 1927. Two shafts were dug throughout 1925 and 1926 to a depth of between 260 yards (240 m) and 300 yards (270 m). By 1927, the seams were located at a depth of 711 yards (650 m), with the coal seam itself extending for 94 feet (29 m). Upton mined mainly from the Barnsley Seam, but also had workings in the Beamshaw and Winter seams. Coal was taken out of the site via the former Hull and Barnsley railway line (which was being run by the London and North Eastern Railway by the time of the colliery's operation).
