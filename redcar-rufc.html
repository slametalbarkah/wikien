            Redcar Rugby Union Football Club known as Redcar Rugby Club or RRUFC, is an English rugby union club for the local town of Redcar, located in North Yorkshire. It currently plays in Counties 2 Durham &amp; Northumberland following the club's promotion as champions, from Durham/Northumberland 3 at the end of the 2019-20 season. RRUFC currently run two senior teams, the 1XV and the Mariners. The Mariners ply their trade in the Tees Valley Social League.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>The club was first mentioned in a letter to the Evening Gazette dated 23 November 1920 when Mr. H.L.De Roper, who was staying at the Coatham Hotel, wrote to the editor suggesting that it was time that the town of Redcar had its own rugby club. "I am only a temporary resident at Redcar, so cannot take the initiative myself, but I am sure a XV could be raised in the town if someone would take the matter in hand. Perhaps, sir, you would help by publishing this letter, and a meeting of anyone interested could be arranged, but as I am leaving the town this week for some time I cannot take the lead myself."<br/><br/>On 3 December later that year whilst playing against South Bank at the racecourse it was noted that after scoring their opening try Redcar had 16 players on the field and one was asked to leave. Redcar won the game 18-9.<br/><br/>The name of Mackinlay has been known in rugby circles for many years.
