            Kho Laen (Thai: คอแลน)  is a tambon (subdistrict) located in the northeastern region of Buntharik district, in Ubon Ratchathani Province, Thailand. In 2021, it had a population of 13,260 people. Neighbouring subdistricts are (clockwise from the south) Phon Ngam, Nong Sano, Ban Maet, and Non Ko, as well as the Champassack district of Laos in the east.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>The area was first settled in 1792 by a group of villagers evacuated from Pi Ler village (บ้านปิเหร่อ) in Sisaket province; the first settlement was called "Khua Mi" (ขัวหมี), located on the west bank of the Lam Dom Noi River, which is Nong Bua village in the present day. Due to the outbreak, the original settlers resettled 4 kilometers eastwards to a new location, Kho Laen village, on the east side of the river. A new village was named after a tropical fruit tree known as "Korlan" (Nephelium hypoleucum), which was found numerously in the area.<br/><br/>Kho Laen was one of the three oldest subdistricts (tambon) of the Buntharik district, together with Phon Ngam and Huai Kha. In 1973, the tambon's half-western area became an independent subdistrict, Na Pho, by absorbing seven other villages in the surrounding area. The newly established subdistrict was also separated in 1987 to create the Ban Maet subdistrict.<br/><br/>In the early era, the tambon was governed by the Subdistrict Council of Kho Laen until it was promoted to the Subdistrict Administrative Organization (SAO) in 1997, and to the subdistrict municipality in 2008.
