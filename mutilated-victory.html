            Mutilated victory (Italian: vittoria mutilata) is a term coined by Gabriele D'Annunzio at the end of World War I, used by a part of Italian nationalists to denounce the partial infringement (and request the full application) of the 1915 pact of London concerning territorial rewards in favour of the Kingdom of Italy.<br/><br/>As a condition for entering the war against Austria-Hungary and Germany, Italy was promised, in the treaty of London signed in 1915 with the powers of the Triple Entente, recognition of control over Southern Tyrol, the Austrian Littoral and Dalmatia. These lands were inhabited by Italians which had not become part of the Kingdom upon Italian unification in the late 19th century, Austrian Germans (Tyroleans) and Slavs (Slovenes and Croats). Additionally, Italy was assured ownership of the Dodecanese, possessions in Albania, and a sphere of influence around the Turkish city of Antalya, alongside a possible enlargement of her colonial presence in Africa.<br/><br/>At the end of the war, despite the initial intention of the United Kingdom and France to remain faithful to the pact, objections by the United States, eventually supported by the British and the French, and in particular conflict over the concept of self-determination spelled out by President Wilson in his Fourteen Points, led to the partial disapplication of the agreement and to the retraction of some promises recognized at the onset of the conflict. Italy completed the national unification of the country by annexing the provinces of Trento and Trieste, and also gained South Tyrol, Istria and some colonial compensations, but was not awarded Dalmatia, with the exception of the city of Zara. Fiume, a city with a sizeable Italian population, although not included in the Pact of London, was occupied for a year by volunteers led by D'Annunzio, leading to an international crisis.<br/><br/>Together with the economical cost of mobilization and the social turmoil ensuing from the end of the war, the partial infringement of the treaty is generally believed to have fuelled the consolidation of Italian irredentism and Italian nationalism, and became a focal point in the propaganda, among others, of the National Fascist Party, which sought to expand the borders of the Italian state.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Description ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Italy joined World War I in 1915 on the side of the Allies, after negotiating the secret Treaty of London with the Triple Entente (Britain, France, and Russia). According to the secret pacts of London, the following territories were promised to Italy in case of victory: Trentino and South Tyrol, the Austrian Littoral (Trieste, Gorizia and Gradisca, and Istria), territories in Dalmatia, possessions in Albania (Vlora and Saseno), and compensations in case of a colonial partition of the Central Powers' empires.
