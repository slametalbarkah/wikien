            Manuel Rosenberg (January 29, 1897 – April 28, 1967) was an American illustrator, cartoonist, writer, lecturer, teacher, editor, and publisher. From 1917 to 1930, he was the chief artist for the Scripps-Howard chain of newspapers and the art editor of the Cincinnati Post.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Biography ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Early years ===<br/><br/><br/><br/>Manuel (or Emmanuel) Rosenberg was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, on January 29, 1897, to Jewish immigrant parents. His father, Benjamin Rosenberg (1869–1941), was a cap maker born in Minsk and his mother, Celia Jasin Rosenberg (1873–1958), was born in Brest to parents born in Breslau (now Wrocław, Poland). <br/><br/>The family moved to Cincinnati shortly after his birth. The Rosenbergs were a working-class Yiddish-speaking family that lived in the Over-the-Rhine immigrant neighborhood near downtown. Rosenberg's two siblings, Simon (1899-1981) and Jessie Rosenberg Tyroler (1901-1987), were both born in Cincinnati before Benjamin left the family and moved to California. Celia ran Rosenberg's, the family dry goods store, with Simon. Jessie married an optometrist and moved to Columbus. Manuel was the only family member to stay in touch with his father, who remarried in 1911 to Jennie Schafland (or Shefflen) and had a daughter, Adella Rosenberg Strauss (1912–2006).
