            Terence Charles Yorath (born 27 March 1950) is a Welsh former football player and manager at both club and international level.<br/><br/>He represented Leeds United, Coventry City, Tottenham Hotspur, Vancouver Whitecaps, Bradford City, Swansea City and the Welsh national team. He later became a football manager for Bradford City, Swansea City, Cardiff City and Sheffield Wednesday, as well as assistant at Huddersfield Town. Yorath also managed the Wales and Lebanon national teams.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Club career ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Early career ===<br/><br/>Yorath was an apprentice at Leeds United signing professional forms at the age of 17. Along with other Leeds midfield players of the time, such as Mick Bates and Terry Hibbitt, he found it difficult to establish himself ahead of Don Revie's preferred pairing of Billy Bremner and Johnny Giles. Between 1967 and 1972 he made just 14 League appearances for Leeds.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Leeds United ===<br/><br/>In the 1972–73 season, injuries and suspensions allowed Yorath to establish himself as a first team regular. His first season ended with two cup final runners-up medals; he was a substitute in the 1973 FA Cup Final, which Leeds lost 1–0 to Sunderland, and also appeared in the 1973 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final, which Leeds lost in controversial circumstances to AC Milan.<br/><br/>Yorath finally won some silverware the following 1973–74 season, where he was a key member of the Leeds championship winning side.
