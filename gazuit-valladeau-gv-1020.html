            The Gazuit-Valladeau GV-103 Gazelle was a French-built light two- to four-seat training, aerobatic and touring aircraft of the late 1960s.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Design and development ==<br/><br/>The first GV-103L, as it was originally called, was a two- or three-seat light touring aircraft first flown in 1969. Later referred to as the GV-103 and powered by an 86 kW (115 hp) Lycoming O-235 flat-four engine, it led to several production variants with two, three and four seats using engines of increasing power within the same airframe. It had a side-by-side seating layout and a fixed tricycle undercarriage with a longer nosewheel which gave the aircraft a pronounced tail-down attitude on the ground.  Its construction was primarily metal but included some glass fibre structures and plastic bonding, novel at the time.<br/><br/>First flown on 1 May 1969, the GV-103 first appeared in public at the Paris Air Show in June 1969. The first two-seat production prototype GV-1020 Gazelle was on display at the Paris 1971 Show.  It was intended to meet a club market for basic and aerobatic training.<br/><br/>The second Gazelle to fly was the prototype of the four-seat GV-1031 tourer, powered by a 112 kW (150 hp) Lycoming O-320 flat-four engine.  An intermediate, three-seat variant with a Rolls-Royce built 97 kW (130 hp) Continental O-240 engine was planned but may not have been built.
