            Sergei Markotun (1890–1971), better known as Serge Marcotoune, was born on July 15, 1890, in St. Petersburg. He was an influential figure in European diplomacy and Martinism during the first decades of the 20th century.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Biography ==<br/><br/>His father was a doctor of the Royal House and his mother the daughter of a Ukrainian Orthodox priest. Thanks to them, he acquired a deep interest in politics and spirituality, which he tried to harmonise throughout his life. It is because of this desire to balance opposites that Marcotoune became one of the most discreet and influential figures in European diplomacy and Martinism during the first decades of the 20th century.<br/><br/>His first steps in esotericism were taken in 1912, while he was studying Law, History and Philology. Around this time, the Martinist Order organised by Papus was going through a period of renewal in Russia. Czeslaw Czynski was presiding over the Martinist lodges from afar, Grigori Ottonovich Mebes’ group had become independent and Piotr Kaznacheev had just been confirmed as Interim Delegate of the Martinist Order. It is in this context of change that the young Marcotoune received his first degree from Kaznacheev, and was commissioned to found a Martinist lodge in Kiev.
