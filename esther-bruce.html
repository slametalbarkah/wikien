            Josephine Esther Bruce (29 November 1912 – 17 July 1994) was a British seamstress living in London. Her autobiography, Aunt Esther's Story published in 1991 and co-authored with her adopted nephew Stephen Bourne, was one of the first books to document the life of a black working-class woman in Britain.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life ==<br/><br/>Esther Bruce was born on 29 November 1912 at 15 Dieppe Street, Fulham, in west London. Her parents were Joseph Adolphus Bruce (1880–1941), a builder's labourer from British Guiana, and his London-born wife, Edith, who died in 1918 when Esther was just five years old.<br/><br/>Formerly a merchant seaman, Joseph settled in Fulham at the turn of the century and worked as a coach painter and film extra until his death in 1941 from an accident in an air raid. He appeared in films such as Sanders of the River (1935) and Chu Chin Chow (1934).<br/><br/>For many years, Esther and her father were among the few black members of their working-class community where she attended North End Road School, Fulham. Joseph taught his daughter to have pride in being black and being British and to stand up to racism. When a teacher at Bruce's school told her classmates "not to talk to coloured people", it was Joseph's complaints which resulted in the teacher being dismissed.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Later life and career ==<br/><br/>Bruce left school when she was 14 years old to work in domestic service but, after being exploited, she changed careers and found work as a seamstress.
