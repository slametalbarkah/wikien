            German Nikolaevich Kim (Russian: Герман Николаевич Ким; Korean: 게르만 킴; born 16 July 1953) is Director of the Institute for Asian Studies at Al-Farabi University, Kazakhstan and one of the leading internationally recognized scholars on ethnic Koreans in the former Soviet Union: Koryo-saram.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Biography ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Early life ===<br/><br/>Kim was born 16 July 1953 in Ushtobe, Taldy-Kurgan Oblast, Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic, one of three sons of Nikolai Kim (also known by his Korean name Kim Dyunbin), a safety engineer and premises manager at the Korean Theatre of Kazakhstan. He jokingly refers to his hometown as the "Korean capital" of the former Soviet Union. He entered Kazakh National University (now known as Al-Farabi University) in 1971 as a student of world history and German language; after his graduation in 1977, he found work as a teacher of German, which he continued until the mid-eighties.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Decision to study Koryo-saram history ===<br/><br/>In 1985, with the onset of perestroika and glasnost, it became permitted for the first time to speak openly of the deportation of Koreans in the Soviet Union and other tragedies which had afflicted the Koryo-saram. This piqued Kim's interest in the history of his ancestors, and in 1987, he returned to Kazakh National University as a doctoral candidate, writing his thesis on the topic of "Socio-Cultural Development of Koreans in Kazakhstan in 1946–1966"; after graduation up until today, he has continued his work in the field of Koryo-saram and Korean diasporas studies.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Other activities ===<br/><br/>German Kim has written and edited a large number of books and papers published internationally. Of those three volumes of the History of Korean Immigration are particularly noteworthy on the history of the Korean Diaspora. Over 70 of his books and papers are available for downloading in academia.edu. Two of his books published in Korean were awarded by the commissions of the Ministry of Culture Republic of Korea for the best book in both 2006 and 2014.
